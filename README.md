# sort_server
Web application and API that returns sorted lines of plain text.

This is a project from the first week of my Software Engineering class, it was a timed in-
class assignement and the task was to deploy a webapp that would receive text and sort it.

It's written in Python3 and uses the Flask framework to define endpoints, forms, and serve content.
